1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,100
Ghost Prison

2
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,300
Liu Qingyan

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:14,900
Liu Qingyan, the eldest miss of the Liu family

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,700
Chen Ye

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,900
Lord of the Prison

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,100
This level of strength

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,700
Is it okay?

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,300
Yeah.

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:20,900
My lord.

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,700
Another woman has arrived outside.

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,300
She is making a fuss to see you.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,500
Why is there another one?

13
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,300
Which number is this?

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,500
In response to my lord,

15
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,700
This is already the 14th one.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,100
This can't go on like this.

17
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:32,900
You let that woman wait a moment.

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,100
I'll go over there shortly.

19
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,300
Yes.

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,300
You are Chen Ye.

21
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:44,900
That's right.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,100
I am Liu Qingyan.

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,500
Your nominal fiancÃ©e.

24
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,300
However, from now on...

25
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,100
You and I have no more connection whatsoever.

26
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,300
You don't need to think about it.

27
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,500
Why are you trying to entangle me?

28
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,700
I have an annual salary of over ten million.

29
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,500
Countless luxury cars and villas.

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,700
These are all you have for a lifetime.

31
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,900
You won't be able to earn any of it.

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,500
Moreover,

33
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,900
You are still a prisoner.

34
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,100
Prisoner.

35
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,300
Who did you hear that from?

36
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,700
You don't need to care who I heard it from.

37
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,900
You are destined to be unworthy of me.

38
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,100
If you know what's good for you...

39
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,900
Then take out the marriage certificate.

40
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,500
I might be generous.
